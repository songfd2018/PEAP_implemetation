# Reproduce the Figures and Tables in PEAP manuscript

We propose a distribution-free hypothesis testing to extract phenotype-enriched (PE) gene pairs across multiple phenotypes, called phenotype enrichment analysis for gene pairs (PEAP). Then, we build gene pair signitures from PE gene pairs for phenotype classification and prognosis diagnosis.

This repository provides the code to reproduce the results and figures in our manuscript.
